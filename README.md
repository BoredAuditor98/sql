Hi all, I'm not sure how many people will see this page but just wanted to share my SQL project related to discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation method. DCF valuation is a method used by finance guys (not myself, I'm an accounting auditor) to derive projected values of investments like stocks. I have no professional experience in SQL, and this is my very first project, so please be kind.. :)

I'm sharing this project so that those who need it can use it (obviously), but also because whole project is a HUGE MESS (lots of nested selects, too long in general, way too specific financial statement line item names, etc.), and I'm hoping to gain more insights from professionals to optimize the lines. The stock used in my project is Microsoft (ticker: msft). You can download the data using python's yfinance (Yahoo Finance) and clean them up using MS Excel. I've included a short guide for data cleaning (is this even the right term..??). I've never used github, but I guess I can just dump the whole lines to the new file, right? Let me know if there is a better way to share this.
