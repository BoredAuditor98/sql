SQL Projects (Finance)
Hello guys,
I don't know how many people will visit this page but just wanted to share my project publicly
The first project is a finance project related to discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation
  *DCF is a valuation method used by finance guys (not myself, I'm an accounting auditor) to project values of certain investments like stocks
I'm sharing this so that you guys can use it (obviously), but also because this project is a HUGE MESS (lots of nested selects, too specific financial statement line item names, etc.), and I'm hoping you guys can help me improve it
Hopefully y'all will leave comments to let me know how I can improve / optimize it
Thanks!

The DCF project uses Microsoft (msft) financial statements and stock data derived from Yahoo Finance (or yfinance)
I included "steps" to prepare the data, which you can download using python and clean using excel, throughout the codes
